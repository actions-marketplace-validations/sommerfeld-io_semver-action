Docker Compose config to streamline building and running the semver application locally.

== Overview

The provided Docker Compose configuration streamlines the development process of the
Docker image used for the GitHub Action. It automates several essential tasks, including building
the binary from the Go sources, testing the Go app, creating the Docker image `local/semver:dev`
that encapsulates the binary, and running tests against a container that uses this image. This
allows developers to focus on their code and rapidly iterate during the development and testing
phases.

To run this Compose config, use xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/semver-sh.adoc[`src/main/semver.sh`]
bash script.
