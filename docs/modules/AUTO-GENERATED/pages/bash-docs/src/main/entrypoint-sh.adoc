Entrypoint for Github Action.

== Overview

The script is intended to serve as the entrypoint for a Docker image running in an Alpine-based
container. It acts as a bridge to the `semver` binary, which is the main functionality of the containerized
application.

CAUTION: Since the base image is Alpine, it doesn't have Bash available and uses Sell instead. So, the
entrypoint must be specified as `#!/bin/sh` instead of `#!/bin/bash`. running this script directly outside
the Docker container could potentially cause trouble since it relies on `#!/bin/sh` as the shebang. If
executed on a system that expects #!/bin/bash, it may lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior.

The purpose of this script is to provide an interface between the user and the semver binary inside the container.
It allows users to pass arguments to the semver binary .

=== Script Arguments

* _$1_ (string): The `semver` command
* _$2_ (string): The argument to pass to the `semver` command
* _$2_ (string): Flags to pass to the `semver` command (optional)
