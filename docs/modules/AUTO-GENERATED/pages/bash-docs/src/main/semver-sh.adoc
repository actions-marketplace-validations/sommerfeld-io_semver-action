Build, test and run the semver app and Docker image locally.

== Overview

This script is designed to build and test the Semver Docker image using Docker Compose. It
starts a Docker Compose Stack that performs a series of essential steps, including initializing Go modules,
running Go tests, building the binary from the Go app, and creating the Docker image with the binary.
Additionally, the script executes tests within several containers to ensure the functionality of the Docker
image.

=== Script Arguments

* _$@_ (...): The same parameters as `semver` app.

=== Script Example

has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.2 on top of Ubuntu 22.10. With Docker installed,
users can execute the script to build and test the Semver Docker image without any additional dependencies.
