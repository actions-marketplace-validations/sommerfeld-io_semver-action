== About this project
The semver-action repository provides a GitHub Action that enables the validation of semantic versions in all Deploy + Release workflows used within the sommerfeld-io organization. This action helps ensure consistent and accurate versioning across projects by enforcing the rules defined in the link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] specification.

By incorporating the `semver-action` into the `Deploy + Release workflows` of all repositories in the sommerfeld-io organization, software projects can ensure consistent and accurate semantic versioning, contributing to improved release processes and efficient collaboration.

=== About Semantic Versioning
Semantic versions are applied in the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io GitHub organization]. All Versions follow the pattern `major.minor.bugfix` for stable versions (e.g. `v0.1.2`) and `major.minor.bugfix-SNAPSHOT` for unstable versions, that are still under active development (e.g. `v0.1.2-SNAPSHOT`). The leading `v` in lowercase is mandatory

== How to use this project
The ``semver-action`` is specifically designed as a GitHub Actions workflow action, intended to be integrated into workflows. It is specifically utilized as part of the "Deploy + Release workflows" within the link:https://github.com/sommerfeld-io[sommerfeld-io GitHub organization]. However, the Dockerfile used in this action can also be employed independently for other purposes, allowing for versatile and standalone usage beyond GitHub Actions workflows.
